In this assignment
I merely followed TA's hints on PDF or the line in code.
Besides,I added some lines in the provided ServerSample as the approach as we have practiced in previous lab or assignment
and I copy the yellow duck's server IU to display the connecting state on a textarea with scroll in this assignment.
As for AndroidPractice,
I added the layout for connecting with server and some code about connecting with IP and after connecting ,we can start to calculate.
The difficulty:
the biggest trouble I encountered was to understand the code TA had provided,after comprehending them,it wasn't difficult to finish the code.
